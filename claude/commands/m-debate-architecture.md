# Strategic Architecture Review Workflow

**Analysis target:** $ARGUMENTS

Focuses on the high-level structure, long-term health, and strategic evolution of the system.
Supported targets: specific modules, directories, or "all".
Example: "src/api", "all modules"

## Commands:

1. **Identify System-Wide Patterns** - Analyze the codebase to identify overarching architectural patterns and design paradigms.

2. **Detect Structural Design Issues** - Scan for high-level design anomalies, including tight coupling between modules, and architectural anti-patterns.

3. **Evaluate Strategic "-ilities"** - Assess the system's overall extensibility, scalability, and long-term maintainability.

4. **Propose High-Level Refactoring** - Generate a prioritized list of structural refactoring strategies with clear goals.

5. **Produce Strategic Report** - Summarize findings in a comprehensive architecture report with strategic recommendations.
